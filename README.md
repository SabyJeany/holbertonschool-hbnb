# holbertonschool-hbnb
HBnB (AirBnB clone) is a step-by-step backend project that reproduces the core logic of a rental platform: object models, serialization, persistent storage, and CRUD operations through an interactive command-line interface. It serves as a foundation for future web, API, and database integration.
